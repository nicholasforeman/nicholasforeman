## About
I am a Game Developer focused on creating experiences on [🎮 Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/users/9221415/profile), currently a Programmer III @Gamefam. My specialties are in Luau/Lau, however I have explored other languages such as C++, Python, Java, and C# in the past. I have a deep interest in game engines, especially advanced concepts, algorithms, and frameworks. Very familiar with communities, public speaking along with communication among developers, client/server replication, quality assurance testing, moderation, and IT solutions.

Along with developing, I enjoy playing games off of Roblox such as Balatro, Le Mans Ultimate, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege, VR, etc. However, my favorite games are actually on Roblox it provides endless opportunities for new content to make and play.
